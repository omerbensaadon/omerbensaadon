### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Omer Bensaadon and I am a Sr. PM @ Github working on AI-related special projects. 

I've worked on:

* Copilot for Docs (now Knowledge Bases)
* Slash commands (type `/` in almost any Markdown surface on GitHub) 
* Issues
* Projects vNext
* Tasklists vNext (Private Beta, lives on in Sub Issues)
* GitHub's Platform (APIs, Webhooks, SDKs)
* other small improvements

If we work together, and you want more information about working with me, check out my Personal User Manual: https://github.com/omerbensaadon/user-manual
